    Writing the Code
Now it’s your turn. Using what you’ve learned, can you
write the code for this program? Give it a try. Just keep these
constraints in mind as you do so:
Constraints
• Enter the tip as a percentage. For example, a 15% tip
would be entered as 15, not 0.15. Your program should
handle the division.
• Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent.
If you can’t figure out how to enforce these constraints, write
the program without them and come back to it later. The
point of these exercises is to practice and improve.
And if this program is too challenging for you right now,
jump ahead and do some of the easier programs in this book
first, and then come back to this one.
