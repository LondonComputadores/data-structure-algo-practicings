"""
    Onward!
Try to tackle each problem in the book using this strategy
to get the most out of the experience. Discover your inputs,
processes, and outputs. Develop some test plans, come up
with some pseudocode, and write the program. Then accept
the various challenges after each program. Or go in your
own direction. Or write the program in as many languages
as you can.
But most of all, have fun and enjoy learning
